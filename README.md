# Rutgers-Cryptocurrencies

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project is to use utilize unsupervised machine learning techniques to
perform a dimensionality reduction and clustering on a set of cryptocurrency data. First
the data will be preprocessed. 

The work thus far is outlined in Python code and the preprocessing and PCA are complete. Developing
the elbow curve and processing the K-means algorithm segments of the code will be reconfigured and  
be tested before creating a visualizations section.
