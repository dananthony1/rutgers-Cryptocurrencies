# Rutgers-Cryptocurrencies

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project is to use utilize unsupervised machine learning techniques to
perform a dimensionality reduction and clustering on a set of cryptocurrency data. First
the data will be preprocessed. 

The work thus far is outlined in Python code and the preprocessing is underway. Once the
preprocessing is finalized the remainder of the PCA and K-means segments of the code will 
be tested before creating a visualizations section.
